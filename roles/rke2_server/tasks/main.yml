# Kube-VIP for HA (Static Pod logic often goes in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/pod-manifests but RKE2 manages its own static pods)
# For RKE2, standard practice is using the Helm Chart or pure manifest in server/manifests
# However, for pure HA bootstrap, we often need the VIP up before the API server binds to it?
# RKE2 binds to 0.0.0.0, so VIP just needs to exist on the interface.
